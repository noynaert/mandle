## Graphics

### Text output:  Semigraphics

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigraphics]()

Maybe do text with just shading and ASCII Art type output.  Also try text output.

Would using 2 adjacent characters make the pixels look more square?   For every logical pixel p, output characters at 2p and 2p+1.  Put the same character or same color in both to make it look squarish.  It seems like it should work.


## Configuration

Use yaml for configuration files.
